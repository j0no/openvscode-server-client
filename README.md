# OpenVSCode Server - Client

 Gitpod recently released [OpenVSCode Server](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/openvscode-server-launch)j so why not have a dedicated client/browserÂ for it.

 At the moment this is just a proof of concept.

## Why?

I still want to have the VS Code seperated from the browser on my latpop.
